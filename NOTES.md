**Notes On Codebase**

Starter Ideas:

- What the project does:


- How to run the project:


- Where to find pieces of configuration or important code:
-- project has articles and comments
-- entry file is `./src/server.js` and migrations configuration in `./postgrator-config.js`

- Any questions about the project:


- Any questions about libraries or syntax you aren't familiar with:
-- What are the `async` and `await` statements in `article-route.js`?
-- What is `DISTINCT` in PostgreSQL? in the `articles-service.js` file
-- What are `"json_strip_nulls"` and `"json_build_object"` in PostgreSQL? in `articles-service.js`

-- What are `leftJoin()` and `groupBy()` in PostgreSQL? in `articles-service.js`

- Any questions about choices in the code you don't understand:




- Any improvements you think could be made to the code:



- Issues:
-- The registration does not seem to be working.
-- Error when trying to leave an anonymous comment
-- Authorization console.log()'s are coming back as undefined. Even though the user is logged in so the encoded strings must be there
